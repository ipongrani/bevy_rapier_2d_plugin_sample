## Sample of a working 2d physics with rapier 2d plugin in Bevy

The code shows how to use the ECS pattern in Bevy with the Rapier 2d plugin to create a ball that falls to the ground. 

This is based off the example provided from the Rapier documentation: https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/getting_started_bevy


This codebase has an added function that listens to the "F" key from the keyboard and adds a "lift" to ball when pressed.
